    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This simple feast is a traditional Chilean dish that originates in the island of Chiloe, one of Patagonia's northern most and larger islands. This dish is an assortment of meats and seafood that was traditionally prepared in a hole with hot stones, covered with Chilean "nalca" leaves (a variation of rhubarb). Today, this dish is often prepared in a pot over a stove, or in a paiella disk over a grill. The latter is recommended, but you will need a cover for the disk; if you have any rhubarb leaves, or nalca leaves if you're lucky, those will work too in a pinch. While the dish requires various ingredients, cooking it could not be simpler, and you will be able to serve a small crowd with this amount of food. If using a pot, be certain that it is a large one, you will serve 6-8 people with this recipe.</p>
