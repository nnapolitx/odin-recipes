brutalist recipe website

This website will demonstrate my working knowledge of HTML5 language, and that I am able to:
1. Create, open, move and delete directories and files using the terminal.
2. Use Git and GitHub to create and develop a project using a DVCS.
3. Create a website for recipes that contains links, strong text, various headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists and other styles of text within HTML.
4. Create absolute and relative links within that website.
5. Add images.
